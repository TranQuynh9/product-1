## About me

Dear Reader,

I'm Quynh a curious boy who was born in Ninh Binh province in 1995. I graduated Academy of Finance and learned Python language course at [Pymi.vn][0], this is my website application after the course finished.

I want to automatic tasks, developing useful application and the AlphaGo match against Lee Sedol inspired me so I chose Python because of its easy learning.

**[Pymi.vn][0]** helped me a lot with fundamentals, Mr. Nguyen Viet Hung is *cool* guy, I wished I've known this course sooner instead of practicing by myself. If you have interested in it, please take a look [Pymi.vn][0].

My website crawled jobs from [awesome jobs](https://github.com/awesome-jobs/vietnam), posts from [Familug](https://www.familug.org/), lotto checking, display coffee shop on the map, use API to create a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/wQfnAaCQ) (and more things will be added soon) which used Python language mainly included:

* Flask,
* Requests,
* Beautiful Soup,
* Lot of things

Through doing this application made me feel like falling into a rabbit hole of unlimited knowledge but I'm so happy, release, and motivated when my scripts run. So I want to work in the programming field to explore more about it and feed me (of course).

This is my [skills](http://product-1.herokuapp.com/cv) I can do and [projects](https://github.com/TranQuynh9) I made. If you need me to join your team, please contact number **0818 333 829** or mail quynhtn29@gmail.com. Thank you!

Hope you have a great day.

Best regard,

Q
